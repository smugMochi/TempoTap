# Tempo Tap
Inspired by [this online tool](http://www.all8.com/tools/bpm.htm).

Simply tap in sync with the rhythm of a song to get its tempo. The more taps, the more accurate the result will be.

Special thanks to [a friend of mine](https://github.com/Flutterwondershy) for suggestions related to the UI!
